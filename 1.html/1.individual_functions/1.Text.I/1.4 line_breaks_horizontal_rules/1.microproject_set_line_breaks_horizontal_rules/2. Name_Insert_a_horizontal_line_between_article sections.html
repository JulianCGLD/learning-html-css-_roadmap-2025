    <h1>Russia Unleashes Largest Drone Assault of War, Setting Government Building Ablaze</h1>
    <p>Ukrainians said it was the first time a key building in Kyiv’s government district had been damaged since the war began. Russia has kept attacking despite Trump administration efforts at peace talks.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Russia attacked Ukraine on Sunday with the largest drone assault so far in the war, Ukrainian authorities said, damaging a key building in the heavily guarded government district of the capital for the first time since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022.
    Ukraine’s Air Force said that Russia had launched 805 Iranian-designed Shahed exploding drones and decoys across the country, the latest in a relentless offensive that has continued unabated despite the Trump administration’s efforts to mediate peace talks. Before Sunday’s assault, the largest attack was on July 9, when Russia launched 728 drones.</p>
