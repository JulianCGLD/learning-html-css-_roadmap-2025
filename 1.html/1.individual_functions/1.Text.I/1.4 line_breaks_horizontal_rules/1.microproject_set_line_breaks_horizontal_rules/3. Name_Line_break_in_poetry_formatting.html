  Evening, a sudden clearing of the mist,<br>
  For now a fine, soft rain is freshening.<br>
  It falls and it did fall. Rain is a thing<br>
  That no doubt always happens in the past.<br>
  <br>
  Hearing it fall, the senses will be led<br>
  Back to a bless√®d time that first disclosed<br>
  To the child a flower that was called the rose<br>
  And an extraordinary color, red.<br>
  These drops that blind our panes to the world outside<br>
  Will brighten the black grapes on a certain trellis<br>
  Out in the far, lost suburbs of the town<br>
  Where a courtyard was. The rain coming down<br>
  Brings back the voice, the longed-for voice,<br>
  Of my father, who has come home, who has not died.
