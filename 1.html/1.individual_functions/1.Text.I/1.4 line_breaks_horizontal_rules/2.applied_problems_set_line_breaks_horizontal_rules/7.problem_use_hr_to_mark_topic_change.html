    <p>BRICS is an intergovernmental organization comprising ten countries â€“ Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. The idea of a BRICS-like group can be traced back to Russian foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov and to the two forums RIC (Russia, India, China) and IBSA (India, Brazil, South Africa).</p>

    <p>Some in the West consider BRICS the alternative to the G7.[12] Others describe the grouping as an incoherent joining of countries around increasing anti-Western and anti-American objectives.</p>
