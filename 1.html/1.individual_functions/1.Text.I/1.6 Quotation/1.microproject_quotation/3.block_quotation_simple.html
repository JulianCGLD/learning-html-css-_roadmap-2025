        <p>
            Nirvana was an American rock band formed in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1987. Founded by singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic, the band went through a succession of drummers—most notably Chad Channing—before recruiting Dave Grohl in the fall of 1990. The band's success popularized alternative rock, and they were often referred to as the flagship band of Generation X. Despite a short professional career lasting only seven years, their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern rock culture.
