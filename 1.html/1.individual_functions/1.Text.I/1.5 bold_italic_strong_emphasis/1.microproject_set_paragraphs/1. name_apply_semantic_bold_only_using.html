    <p><strong>"Torms"</strong> could refer to TORM, a Danish shipping company specializing in product tankers that transport refined oil products like gasoline and diesel, or Els Torms, a small village in the province of Lleida, Catalonia, Spain. It could also be a misspelling of storms, <strong>referring to violent weather</strong> or a reference to Torm, a fictional deity from the Forgotten Realms campaign setting in the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game. <strong>Maybe this definition is incorrect, validate in your navigator</strong> </p>
