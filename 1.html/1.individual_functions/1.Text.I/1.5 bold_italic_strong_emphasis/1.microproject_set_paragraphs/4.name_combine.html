    <h1>Chinese Communist Party</h1>
    <p>The <strong>Communist Party of China (CPC)</strong> commonly known as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP),[4] is the founding and ruling party of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Founded in 1921, the CCP won the Chinese Civil War against the Kuomintang and proclaimed the establishment of the PRC under the chairmanship of Mao Zedong in October 1949. The CCP has since governed China and has had sole control over the country's armed forces and law enforcement. As of 2024, the CCP has more than 100 million members, making it the second largest political party by membership in the world.</p><br>

    <p>In 1921, <em>Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao</em> founded the CCP with the help of the Far Eastern Bureau of the Russian Communist Party <em>(Bolsheviks)</em> and Far Eastern Bureau of the Communist International. Although the CCP aligned with the Kuomintang (KMT) during its initial years, the rise of the KMT's right-wing under the leadership of <em>Chiang Kai-shek</em> and subsequent massacres of tens of thousands of CCP members resulted in a split and a prolonged civil war between the CCP and KMT. During the next ten years of guerrilla warfare, <em>Mao Zedong rose</em> to become the most influential figure in the CCP and the party established a strong base among the rural peasantry with its land reform policies. Support for the CCP continued to grow throughout the Second Sino-Japanese War. <strong>After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the CCP emerged triumphant in the communist revolution against the Nationalist government.</strong> The CCP established the People's Republic of China on 1 October 1949 and the remnants of the Nationalist government retreated to Taiwan shortly after.
