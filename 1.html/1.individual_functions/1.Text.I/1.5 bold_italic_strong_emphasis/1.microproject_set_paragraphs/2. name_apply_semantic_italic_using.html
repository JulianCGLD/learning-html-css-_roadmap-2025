    <p><em>Catalonia</em> is an autonomous community of Spain, designated as a nationality by its Statute of Autonomy. Most of its territory <em>(except the Val d'Aran)</em> is situated on the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula, to the south of the Pyrenees mountain range. Catalonia is administratively divided into four provinces or eight vgeueries <em>(regions)</em>, which are in turn divided into 43 comarques. The capital and largest city, <em>Barcelona</em>, is the second-most populous municipality in Spain and the fifth-most populous urban area in the European Union.[12]</p>
