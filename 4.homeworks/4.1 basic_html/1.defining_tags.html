Copilot explain all the functions of the code above in detail.
The provided code is a simple HTML document that demonstrates the basic structure of an HTML file and includes references to external CSS and JavaScript files. Below is a detailed explanation of each part of the code:
1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used. In this case, it specifies that the document is an HTML5 document.
2. `<html lang="en">`: This is the root element of the HTML document. The `lang` attribute specifies the language of the document, which is English in this case.
3. `<head>`: This section contains meta-information about the document, such as its character encoding, viewport settings, title, and links to external resources like CSS files.
   - `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: This meta tag specifies the character encoding for the document, which is UTF-8. This ensures that the document can display a wide range of characters from different languages.
   - `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: This meta tag is important for responsive web design. It sets the viewport to match the device's width and sets the initial zoom level to 1.0, ensuring that the webpage is displayed correctly on different devices (e.g., mobile phones, tablets).
   - `<title>Defining Tags</title>`: This tag sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser tab and is used by search engines.
   - `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`: This link tag references an external CSS file named "styles.css". The `rel` attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked resource (in this case, a stylesheet), and the `href` attribute provides the URL of the CSS file.
    `<body>`: This section contains the content of the HTML document that will be displayed in the web browser. It includes various HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, etc.
   - `<h1>`: This tag defines a top-level heading. In this case, it contains the text "Write, run, and share HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code online." Headings are important for structuring content and improving accessibility.
   - `<p>`: This tag defines a paragraph of text. Here, it contains the text "Our HTML editor updates the webview automatically in real-time as you write code." Paragraphs are used to group related sentences together.
   - `<script src="script.js"></script>`: This script tag references an external JavaScript file named "script.js". The `src` attribute specifies the URL of the JavaScript file. This allows you to include JavaScript code that can add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the webpage.
